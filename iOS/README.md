# Boost iOS Client

This portion of the project runs on an iOS device and connects to the peripheral device hooked into the vehicle. It communicates over bluetooth low energy, reporting CAN information received from the peripheral along. It is also in charge of executing steering wheel control controls.

## Build Notes

The build is entirely enclosed within the Xcode project in the root directory, just build/run the iOS Boost target.
